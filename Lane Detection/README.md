# Lane Detection
We aim to do simple Lane Detection to mimic Lane Departure Warning systems used in SelfDriving Cars.  You are provided with two video sequences (both are required for this assignment), taken from aself driving car. We design an algorithm to detect lanes on the road,as well as estimate the road curvature to predict car turns.

## DataSet Download
The dataset can be downloaded from here : 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8DbLKogb5ktT2F5THBVR0hObHM

Place the `challenge_video.mp4` and `project_video.mp4` in the same folder as the code.

## How to run code
1. Unzip the folder which has the code and input sequences
2. Eachofthefollowingcodepartsasksyoutoselecttheinputsequenceyouwouldliketorun the code with.
3. Run `python ./part_1.py` to start Lane detection
